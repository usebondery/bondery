# Changelog instructions

The changelog lives at [docs/changelog.md](../../docs/changelog.md).

## Guiding Principles

These principles should be followed when writing and maintaining the changelog:

- Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
- There should be an entry for every single version.
- The same types of changes should be grouped.
- Versions and sections should be linkable.
- The latest version comes first.
- The release date of each version is displayed.
- Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

## Types of changes

Each change or new functionality must be categorized into one of the following types and the commit message must be prefixed accordingly:

| Title            | Description                                       | Prefix      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| ✨ Added         | New features                                      | `feat:`     |
| 🐛 Fixed         | Bug fixes                                         | `fix:`      |
| 🔄 Changed       | Changes in existing functionality                 | `refactor:` |
| 🔒 Security      | Vulnerability fixes                               | `security:` |
| 📝 Documentation | Documentation-only changes                        | `docs:`     |
| 🎨 Style         | Code style changes (formatting, whitespace, etc.) | `style:`    |
| ⚡ Performance   | Performance improvements                          | `perf:`     |
| 🧪 Tests         | Adding or correcting tests                        | `test:`     |
| 🤖 CI            | CI configuration or script changes                | `ci:`       |
| 📦 Dependencies  | Dependency upgrades                               | `deps:`     |

## Format

Each version section should start with a header that includes the version number and release date in the following format:

```markdown
