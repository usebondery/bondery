2. **Chrome Extension** (`apps/chrome-extension`): A Chrome extension to integrate with various Social Media platforms

Both applications share common packages located in the `apps/` directory.

- **Translations**: Shared translation files for internationalization

### Tech-stack

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sveetya/bondery
cd bondery
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

**Chrome Extension:**
```bash
cd apps/chrome-extension
cp .env.production.example .env.production.local
cp .env.development.example .env.development.local
# Edit both files and fill in all required values
```

**Web App:**
```bash
cd apps/web
cp .env.production.example .env.production.local
cp .env.development.example .env.development.local

## ⚙️ Turborepo remote caching
This monorepo is set up to use Turborepo's remote caching feature. This allows build outputs to be shared across different environments (e.g., CI/CD pipelines), speeding up builds significantly.

```bash
npx turbo login
npx turbo link

```

## 🛠️ Development

### Run all apps in development mode

To start all applications in development mode simultaneously:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- **Web App**
- **Chrome Extension**

### Run specific app

To run/build/start a specific app only, use the `--filter` flag:

```bash
# Run only the web app
npm run dev --filter=web

# Run only the chrome extension (when available)
npm run dev --filter=chrome-extension
```

## 🏗️ Build

### Build All Apps

To build all applications for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

After building, you can start the production server:

```bash
npm run start
```
